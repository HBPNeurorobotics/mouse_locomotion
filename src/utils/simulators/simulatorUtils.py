# Mouse Locomotion Simulation
#
# Human Brain Project SP10
#
# This project provides the user with a framework based on Blender allowing:
#  - Edition of a 3D model
#  - Edition of a physical controller model (torque-based or muscle-based)
#  - Edition of a brain controller model (oscillator-based or neural network-based)
#  - Simulation of the model
#  - Optimization of the parameters in distributed cloud simulations
